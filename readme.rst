ESC Calibration
================

I have T-Motor's ESC (40A OPTO PRO 400Hz).
There is lack of documentation for this model.

The **key point** was that I need to change to 0 right after hearing 2 beeps.

You can find ``esc.ino`` code here.
And just follow the `Youtube video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAw_xqitN4E>`_
